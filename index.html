      <h1>Hi, I'm Ross Brown</h1>
      <h3>I'm a musician turned software developer</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="about">
      <p>I'm a classicaly trained musicain with a BM and MM in Music Performance
        who has decided to make the jump into the tech industry as a software engineer.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before discovering my interest in code, I freelanced as a trumpet player in the DFW and Austin area
        as well as taught private lessons to high school and middle school students. I enjoyed playing
        a variety of music as well as writing and arranging music on the side as well. As I was finishing up my master's
        degree at Southern Methodist Univeristy in Dallas, TX, I began to question whether the life of a musician was
        what I
        wanted to do. I stumbled upon a site called "codecademy.com" and gave learning to program a shot and
        the rest is history. Being able to experience the thrill of learning some new for the first was exicting
        and kept me wanting to learn more and more. As I continue to learn and build with code, I hope to one day be
        able to
        work on interesting and exciting projects that have a big impact in people's lives and maybe even involve music!
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I am enrolled in a 16-week, full-stack engineering program at Rithm School. I hope to gain valuable
        experience, meet new people, and build awesome projects as I reach closer and closer to my goal to becoming a
        software engineer.
