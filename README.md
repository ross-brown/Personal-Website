## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap



## Lessons Learned

This was a great refresher on HTML and CSS by building a website completely from scratch. The most challenging aspect of this project was messing the CSS to make the layout look presentable, especially on mobile devices. Re-learning things like media queires helped create a more responsive website.
